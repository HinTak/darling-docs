# Known partially working software
The following software has been tested and is known to work partially with Darling:

- Classic Finder (https://web.archive.org/web/20220407135022/https://www.classicmacfinder.com/).
  - Works, but has the following bugs:
  - Windows cannot be closed after they lose focus - the window decorations disappear.
  - Sometimes does not respond when trying to browse to system folders.
  - Runs very slowly.
- dotnet (the commandline compiler).
  - Very minimal "hello world" applications compile and run.
